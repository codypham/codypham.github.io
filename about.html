I am able to program in C/C++, Java, ARM Assembly, and HTML. Some work experience I have is I am an official school for the UCSD Computer Science Department, tutoring the intermediate Java course. Some recent projects I've done are implementing Java Sorted ArrayLists in C and ARM assmbly, and rebuilding the 2048 game in Java. In my free time, I've volunteered at the UCSD Medical Center to help patients in the intensive care unit.</p>
